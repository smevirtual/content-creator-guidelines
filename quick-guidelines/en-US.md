# The [SME Virtual Network](https://www.smevirtual.com/) is a volunteer-run endeavor to narrow the engineering and manufacturing skills gap.

### We do this by providing an Internet-based engagement platform where companies, educators, students and professionals can come together to learn, share and collaborate.

## First off, thank you for considering to join us as a contributor!

#### Secondly, please review the guidelines below so that we can build the best possibly community for all.

- We are a welcoming community. Please review our [Participation Guidelines](https://github.com/smevirtual/community-guidelines).

- We embrace [open-source](https://github.com/smevirtual) - particularly for Industry 4.0 education which is very software-based. Open-source is a powerful engagement opportunity for everyone and so we encourage (but not require) our contributors to release their content under a permissive open-source license.

- We ask that direct marketing and selling of products or services by contributors or participants be kept to a minimum. Providing the name of your company, your company website, contact information and a brief description of your products or services is encouraged during events that you produce, but the purpose of this community is to educate.

- Webinars (check out our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7DNeDhrD2a5Ptyo9Rm_mwQ)) are a very popular engagement option. However, as long as your content is accessible over the Internet, we support it! In some cases, the SME Virtual Network partners with physical SME chapters or student chapters for educational events in local communities.

#### Donâ€™t know what to contribute? Here are some good examples!

- Produce a single-day or multiple-day webinar or workshop on our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7DNeDhrD2a5Ptyo9Rm_mwQ).

- Contribute to or start an open-source software project on our [GitHub](https://github.com/smevirtual).

- Host virtual office hours on our [Slack](http://smevirtual.slack.com/) team (if you want an Slack invite to check it out let us know!) or answer member questions on [SME Connect](http://connect.sme.org/home) or our [Industry 4.0 Discussion Forum](https://discuss.smevirtual.com/).
